<h1>Project Goals</h1>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements and specifications for the What’s in My Kitchen? mobile application (hereafter referred to as “WIMK”). This document includes a glossary of relevant terms, outlines of functional and nonfunctional requirements, and UML documentation of specific use cases, activity diagrams, and a high-level class diagram. </p>
<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>WIMK will address the daily needs of its users and serve as a means of saving time and money grocery shopping. WIMK will embrace smart phone technology on the Android platform to provide users with an application to aid in home inventory. The scope of WIMK is broad because it has the potential to be used daily by millions of grocery-buying individuals.</p>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>The main goal of WIMK is to provide a convenient interface, through which users can make informed decisions while grocery shopping as well as save time on unnecessary trips. Our goal is for the user to be able to know what they have in their kitchen without having to go home and check. This application will focus on ease of use and the potential to save its users money. </p>
